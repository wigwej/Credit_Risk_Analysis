# Credit_Risk_Analysis

***Overview of loan prediction analysis***

This project seeks to apply machine learning to solve risks inherent in credit card classification problems of good loans versus bad loans. Using credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer- to-peer lending services, we would deploy techinques to evaluate and train our unbalanced dataset with a view to making predictions and solve credit card risk. We will oversample using Random Over Sampler and SMOTE algorithms, undersample using clustercentroid algorithm; we would use a combination of both oversampling and undersampling by deploying SMOTEENN algorithm, and finally we would use Balanced Random Forent Classifier and Easy Esemble Classifier algorithms to reduce the elemnet of bias and predict credit risk.


***Results***
Using naive random oversampling technique:
The dataset showed an accuracy score of approximately 50%

Precision and recall for majority of the data scored an even low risk of 1.00 and f1 of 0.99, while the moniroty had a high risk of 1.00 precision and 0.01 recall score.

The SMOTE oversampling technoque revealed similar scores.

Using Undersampling technique:

The accurancy report was about average with a score of 51%.

Most of the dataset were low rsik with a high precision score of 1.0 and a recall score of 0.43 and an F1 value of 60%. Pn th eotherhand, the minoritywere high risk with a very low precision and F1 score of 0.01, a slightly above average scoye of 59&.
