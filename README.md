# Credit_Risk_Analysis

***Overview of loan prediction analysis***

This project seeks to apply machine learning to solve risks inherent in credit card classification problems of good loans versus bad loans. Using credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer- to-peer lending services, we would deploy techinques to evaluate and train our unbalanced dataset with a view to making predictions and solve credit card risk. We will oversample using Random Over Sampler and SMOTE algorithms, undersample isong clustercentroid algorithm, we would us Balanced Random Forent Classifier and Easy Esemble Classifier to reduce the elemnet of bias and predict credit risk.
